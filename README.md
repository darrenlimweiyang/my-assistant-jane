## Objective 
I aim to brush up on my python skills while making my life easier. With that in mind, I decided to try and come up with a personal assistant on telegram. (Especially since I have spent so much time on telegram) With that in mind, I aim to create a telegram bot that will accompany me while studying, hitting the gym(?) and other functions not yet thought off.

PS. The telegram group is great as well!
